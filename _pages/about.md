Our primary mission is to develop robust language technologies for **low-resource languages**, with a specialized focus on **Sanskrit** and other Indian languages. We are committed to leveraging an interdisciplinary approach to pioneer innovations, placing a strong emphasis on creating tangible, **real-world impact** through our tools and datasets.

Beyond our core linguistic focus, our group explores broader challenges in:
* Databases & Software Engineering
